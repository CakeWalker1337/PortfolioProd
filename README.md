## _Portfolio Prod. App_

_**Yet another portfolio app**_

### For what?

This app has been designed to be a Flickr portfolio client for the artist you may know as <a href="https://twitter.com/serometa">Serometa</a>. 
</br>Anyways, the source code is opened, so you can try to modify it to make your own portfolio app. 

To launch the app, you need to perform three simple actions:
1. Create your own Flickr api key by following [this link](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/)
2. Add following strings in your `local.properties` in project:
```
api_key_debug="YOUR_API_KEY"
api_key_release="YOUR_API_KEY"
```
3. Build project
